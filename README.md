3. Phone interview with a senior team member
4. Another full-day take-home technical chanllege that's specific to the role ([example](https://github.com/GoodNotes/interviews/blob/master/backend/challenge.md))

6. In-person trial *

### In-person trial *
As the last stage of the interview process, we would like to invite you to our office and work along side with our engineering team for 3 to 5 days depending on your availability. You would be treated as if you were a regular member of ours. We strongly believe that interview is both ways and this is the only way to find out before coming on-board full time.

We would compensate you by your daily rate if you are local and eligible to work in Hong Kong. So the only thing to lose for you is a few vacation days. If you are not in Hong Kong, we would cover your air ticket and accommodation along with a daily meal allowance but we can't compensate by your daily rate due to work visa issue.
