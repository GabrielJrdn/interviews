As the last stage of the interview process, we would like to invite you to our office and work along side with our engineering team for 3 to 5 days depending on your availability. You would be treated as if you were a regular member of ours. We strongly believe that interview is both ways and this is the only way to find out before coming on-board full time.

We would fly you into our office if needed and cover both your air ticket and accomodation. If you are eligible to work in Hong Kong, we would  also compensate you by your current daily rates. If you do require work visa, then we simply cannot compensate you at this point due to work visa restriction. However, we will give you a daily meal allowance to minimize your out-of-pocket expense.
