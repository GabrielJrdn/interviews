Join us to do the best work of your life.

## Overview of our interview process:

1. Tell us what you are passionate about (30 - 45 minutes)
    - First phone interview with a senior team member
2. Show us what you could build (2 - 4 hours)
    - Depending on the role you applied, you would be ask to work on one of these take home challenges
        - [Software Engineering Challenge](software-engineering.md)
        - [Design Challenge](design.md)
3. Meet the founder and the team (6 hours)
    - Full day in-person interview with us at our office
        1. Meet our founder, Steven
        2. Meet the whole company over lunch.
            - As a way for the team to know you better, we ask you to talk about any personal projects you may have or anything you are passionate about (10 minutes).
            - Free lunch on us, of course.
        3. Three to four one-on-two interviews with our senior team members. We may ask you to work on a problem in person with your machine.
            - For software engineering roles, we are mainly interested in your thought process, not if you remember all the syntax or framework interfaces of the chosen programming languages.
        4. Optional happy hour drink with our team
    - If you are not local, we may do one more video conferencing before flying you into Hong Kong.
    - We cover direct flight to Hong Kong in addition to 3 nights of hotel with a total budget of US$300.00.
4. Work with the team (optional, 3 - 5 days)
    - Inspired by the [trial week](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/trial-week-our-hiring-secret/)*, our team would love to have a chance to work with you side by side on real work. We ask you to use some of your vaction days from your current position and come work in our office for a few days. We understand this may not be feasible for you to take time off so we make this trial week optional.
    - We would also fly you into our office if needed and cover both your air ticket and accommodation. If you are eligible to work in Hong Kong, we would also compensate you by your current daily rates. If you do require a work visa, then we simply cannot compensate you at this point due to work visa restriction. However, we will give you a daily meal allowance to minimize your out-of-pocket expense. 
    - We do believe interviews are both ways and we want to offer you a chance to work with us before you commit the next few years with us.
    - We would ensure both sides have a clear expectation on the hiring package before we go into the trial week. Our goal is to be able to give you the offer in person at the end of the trial week. If you elect not to go through a trial week, we typically will have an offer ready to sign within 24 hours after your full day interview.
