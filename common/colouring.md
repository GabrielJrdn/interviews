# GoodColours

### Core Specifications:

1. A colouring app lets users to color a page from its built in library. You can find samples of colouring pages from [here](colouring_pages_samples.zip).

2. Users cannot add, remove or rearrange pages from the library.

3. Colouring pages are always scaled to the screen and users cannot change the zoom factor after.

4. Users can select from a set of predefined colours. Each stroke will colour the corresponding pixels by the selected colour.

5. Users can select an eraser to remove the colour and clear the pixel from any colours that may have been painted on top of the pixel.

6. Every stroke is saved automatically.

7. You are free to make other product decisions as you see fit.

### Public Library Challenge:

1. How would you modify the colouring app above to support a public library? All colouring pages in the public library are synced across all users. You can assume all instances of the app have the same public library and everyone can color over and delete others' pen strokes.

2. How would you ensure the colouring app can support 1 million concurrent users coloring a single page in the public library?
